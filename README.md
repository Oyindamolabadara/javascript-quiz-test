# JAVASCRIPT QUIZ TEST
JavaScript quiz test was created to test users knowledge on JavaScript with no time limit.  It comes in three levels; easy, medium and difficult. For each level, there are 10 questions and users will get 10 points for each correct answer.  At the end of the quiz, the total score will be displayed. Maximum score for each level is 100 points. The user has to input a username for the score to be saved. At the end page, there is a leader board that displays the highest scores.
